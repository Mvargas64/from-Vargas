### Code Fencing

#### Nodes.js

This simple Node.js code is used to capture command-line arguments by utilizing the process module, which provides access to the current Node.js process. It skips the first two arguments, which are the Node.js executable and the script's file name.

```const getCmdArguments = () => process.argv.slice(2); ```

#### Favorite City: Chicago

**Chicago** is my favorite city because is the only city with amazing skyscrapers that I have seen. The last time I visited I went to many places in the city. I saw the Bean, the **Chicago Bears** Stadium, and downtown Chicago. The best part about the trip was the river across the city.
